## GWASCatalogSearchDB

This repository provides a SQLite database designed to facilitate search for GWAS records in the GWAS Catalog database—the NHGRI-EBI Catalog of human genome-wide association studies. This is achieved by combining the EFO ontology mappings specified in the GWAS Catalog metadata with tabular representations of ontology relationships—extracted from a SemanticSQL database representation of EFO—such that users can search for GWAS Catalog records by leveraging the EFO class hierarchy.

The data were downloaded and processed according to the description in the GWASCatalogSearchDB,
<https://github.com/ccb-hms/GWASCatalogSearchDB>.

A schema of the resulting tables is given in Figure \@ref(fig:sqltabs).

```{r sqltabs, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Table descriptions for GWAS catalog processed data."}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/GWASCat.png")
```

**URLs for Data**
The GWAS catalog data are obtained from xhttps://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/
and transformed according to the descriptions in https://github.com/ccb-hms/GWASCatalogSearchDB,
which gives explicit details on which files were obtained, and the dates on which they
were obtained.

**Creation of the word cloud**
We subset first to the set of EFO terms that have an association with the lung and then within that we removed tokens that have fewer than 5 occurrences. And finally we create a word cloud based on the frequency of the tokens that remain.
