## GWASCatalogSearchDB

This repository provides a SQLite database designed to facilitate search for GWAS records in the GWAS Catalog database—the NHGRI-EBI Catalog of human genome-wide association studies. This is achieved by combining the EFO ontology mappings specified in the GWAS Catalog metadata with tabular representations of ontology relationships—extracted from a SemanticSQL database representation of EFO—such that users can search for GWAS Catalog records by leveraging the EFO class hierarchy.

The data were downloaded and processed according to the description in the GWASCatalogSearchDB,
<https://github.com/ccb-hms/GWASCatalogSearchDB>.

A schema of the resulting tables is given in Figure \@ref(fig:sqltabs).

```{r sqltabs, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Table descriptions for GWAS catalog processed data."}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/GWASCat.png")
```
