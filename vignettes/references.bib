In this format, the positions of tokens are maintained, and each token can be annotated (e.g., part-of-speech tags, dependency relations). Prominent features include advanced Lucene-like querying for specific tokens or contexts (e.g., documents, sentences), similarity statistics for words and documents, exporting to DTM for compatibility with many text analysis packages, and the possibility to reconstruct original text from tokens to facilitate interpretation.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Describing biological sample variables with ontologies is complex due to the cross-domain nature of experiments. Ontologies provide annotation solutions; however, for cross-domain investigations, multiple ontologies are needed to represent the data. These are subject to rapid change, are often not interoperable and present complexities that are a barrier to biological resource users., Results: We present the Experimental Factor Ontology, designed to meet cross-domain, application focused use cases for gene expression data. We describe our methodology and open source tools used to create the ontology. These include tools for creating ontology mappings, ontology views, detecting ontology changes and using ontologies in interfaces to enhance querying. The application of reference ontologies to data is a key problem, and this work presents guidelines on how community ontologies can be presented in an application ontology in a data-driven way., Availability: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo, Contact: malone@ebi.ac.uk, Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of chemicals produced from incomplete combustion of carbon-containing products. PAH exposure is associated with pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, and cancer. However, studies on the exposure to PAHs and depression are limited. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between seven types of urinary PAH exposure and depression in the adult population using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)2015-2016 dataset. The nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess for depression; a PHQ-9 score {$\geq$} 10 was considered depressed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis for complex survey procedures was used to assess the relationship between seven types of PAH exposure and depression. A total of 4,123 adults aged {$\geq$}20 years were included in the study sample. All forms of urinary PAHs studied, including 1-hydroxynaphthalene, 2-hydroxynaphthalene, 3-hydroxyfluorene, 2-hydroxyfluorene, 1-hydroxyphenanthrene, 1-hydroxypyrene, and 2 and 3-hydroxyphenanthrene, were positively associated with depression.},

The Catalog contains variant-trait associations and supporting metadata for~{$>$}45 000 published GWAS across~{$>$}5000 human traits, and~{$>$}40 000 full P-value summary statistics datasets. Content is curated from publications or acquired via author submission of prepublication summary statistics through a new submission portal and validation tool. GWAS data volume has vastly increased in recent years. We have updated our software to meet this scaling challenge and to enable rapid release of submitted summary statistics. The scope of the repository has expanded to include additional data types of high interest to the community, including sequencing-based GWAS, gene-based analyses and copy number variation analyses. Community outreach has increased the number of shared datasets from under-represented traits, e.g. cancer, and we continue to contribute to awareness of the lack of population diversity in GWAS. Interoperability of the Catalog has been enhanced through links to other resources including the Polygenic Score Catalog and the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium, refinements to GWAS trait annotation, and the development of a standard format for GWAS data.},

  abstract = {Investigations into the causal underpinnings of disease processes can be aided by the incorporation of genetic information. Genetic studies require populations varied in both ancestry and prevalent disease in order to optimize discovery and ensure generalizability of findings to the global population. Here, we report the genetic determinants of the serum proteome in 466 African Americans with chronic kidney disease attributed to hypertension from the richly phenotyped African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) study. Using the largest aptamer-based protein profiling platform to date (6,790 proteins or protein complexes), we identified 969 genetic associations with 900 unique proteins; including 52 novel cis (local) associations and 379 novel trans (distant) associations. The genetic effects of previously published cis-protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) were found to be highly reproducible, and we found evidence that our novel genetic signals colocalize with gene expression and disease processes. Many trans- pQTLs were found to reflect associations mediated by the circulating cis protein, and the common trans-pQTLs are enriched for processes involving extracellular vesicles, highlighting a plausible mechanism for distal regulation of the levels of secreted proteins. Thus, our study generates a valuable resource of genetic associations linking variants to protein levels and disease in an understudied patient population to inform future studies of drug targets and physiology.},
