  abstract = {A major goal in human genetics is to use natural variation to understand the phenotypic consequences of altering each protein-coding gene in the genome. Here  we used exome sequencing(1) to explore protein-altering variants and their  consequences in 454,787 participants in the UK Biobank study(2). We identified  12\,million coding variants, including around 1\,million loss-of-function and  around 1.8\,million deleterious missense variants. When these were tested for  association with 3,994 health-related traits, we found 564 genes with trait  associations at P\,{$\leq$}\,2.18\,{\texttimes}\,10(-11). Rare variant associations were enriched in  loci from~genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but most (91\%) were independent  of common variant signals. We discovered several risk-increasing associations  with traits related to liver disease, eye disease and cancer, among others, as  well as risk-lowering associations for hypertension (SLC9A3R2), diabetes  (MAP3K15, FAM234A) and asthma (SLC27A3). Six genes were associated with brain  imaging phenotypes, including two involved in neural development (GBE1, PLD1). Of  the signals available and powered for replication~in an independent cohort, 81\%  were confirmed; furthermore, association signals were generally consistent across  individuals of European, Asian and African ancestry. We illustrate the ability of  exome sequencing to identify gene-trait associations, elucidate gene function and  pinpoint effector genes that underlie GWAS signals at scale.},

  abstract = {The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is a widely used resource that comprehensively organizes and defines the phenotypic features of human disease, enabling computational inference and supporting genomic and phenotypic analyses through semantic similarity and machine learning algorithms. The HPO has widespread applications in clinical diagnostics and translational research, including genomic diagnostics, gene-disease discovery, and cohort analytics. In recent years, groups around the world have developed translations of the HPO from English to other languages, and the HPO browser has been internationalized, allowing users to view HPO term labels and in many cases synonyms and definitions in ten languages in addition to English. Since our last report, a total of 2239 new HPO terms and 49235 new HPO annotations were developed, many in collaboration with external groups in the fields of psychiatry, arthrogryposis, immunology~and cardiology. The Medical Action Ontology (MAxO) is a new effort to model treatments and other measures taken for clinical management. Finally, the HPO consortium is contributing to efforts to integrate the HPO and the GA4GH Phenopacket Schema into electronic health records (EHRs) with the goal of more standardized and computable integration of rare disease data in EHRs.},

  abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the most lethal cancers. Its poor prognosis is predominantly due to the fact that most patients remain asymptomatic until the disease reaches an advanced stage, alongside the lack of early markers and screening strategies. A better understanding of PDAC risk factors is essential for the identification of groups at high risk in the population. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been a powerful tool for detecting genetic variants associated with complex traits, including pancreatic cancer. By exploiting functional and GWAS data, we investigated the associations between polymorphisms affecting gene function in the pancreas (expression quantitative trait loci, eQTLs) and PDAC risk. In a two-phase approach, we analysed 13 713 PDAC cases and 43 784 controls and identified a genome-wide significant association between the A allele of the rs2035875 polymorphism and increased PDAC risk (P = 7.14 {\texttimes} 10-10). This allele is known to be associated with increased expression in the pancreas of the keratin genes KRT8 and KRT18, whose increased levels have been reported to correlate with various tumour cell characteristics. Additionally, the A allele of the rs789744 variant was associated with decreased risk of developing PDAC (P = 3.56 {\texttimes} 10-6). This single nucleotide polymorphism is situated in the SRGAP1 gene and the A allele is associated with higher expression of the gene, which in turn inactivates the cyclin-dependent protein 42 (CDC42) gene expression, thus decreasing the risk of PDAC. In conclusion, we present here a functional-based novel PDAC risk locus and an additional strong candidate supported by significant associations and plausible biological mechanisms.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Automatic phenotype concept recognition from unstructured text remains a challenging task in biomedical text mining research. Previous works that address the task typically use dictionary-based matching methods, which can achieve high precision but suffer from lower recall. Recently, machine learning-based methods have been proposed to identify biomedical concepts, which can recognize more unseen concept synonyms by automatic feature learning. However, most methods require large corpora of manually annotated data for model training, which is difficult to obtain due to the high cost of human annotation. RESULTS: In this article, we propose PhenoTagger, a hybrid method that combines both dictionary and machine learning-based methods to recognize Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) concepts in unstructured biomedical text. We first use all concepts and synonyms in HPO to construct a dictionary, which is then used to automatically build a distantly supervised training dataset for machine learning. Next, a cutting-edge deep learning model is trained to classify each candidate phrase (n-gram from input sentence) into a corresponding concept label. Finally, the dictionary and machine learning-based prediction results are combined for improved performance. Our method is validated with two HPO corpora, and the results show that PhenoTagger compares favorably to previous methods. In addition, to demonstrate the generalizability of our method, we retrained PhenoTagger using the disease ontology MEDIC for disease concept recognition to investigate the effect of training on different ontologies. Experimental results on the NCBI disease corpus show that PhenoTagger without requiring manually annotated training data achieves competitive performance as compared with state-of-the-art supervised methods. AVAILABILITYAND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code, API information and data for PhenoTagger are freely available at https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/PhenoTagger.

Genetic studies require populations varied in both ancestry and prevalent disease in order to optimize discovery and ensure generalizability of findings to the global population. Here, we report the genetic determinants of the serum proteome in 466 African Americans with chronic kidney disease attributed to hypertension from the richly phenotyped African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) study. Using the largest aptamer-based protein profiling platform to date (6,790 proteins or protein complexes), we identified 969 genetic associations with 900 unique proteins; including 52 novel cis (local) associations and 379 novel trans (distant) associations. The genetic effects of previously published cis-protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) were found to be highly reproducible, and we found evidence that our novel genetic signals colocalize with gene expression and disease processes. Many trans- pQTLs were found to reflect associations mediated by the circulating cis protein, and the common trans-pQTLs are enriched for processes involving extracellular vesicles, highlighting a plausible mechanism for distal regulation of the levels of secreted proteins. Thus, our study generates a valuable resource of genetic associations linking variants to protein levels and disease in an understudied patient population to inform future studies of drug targets and physiology.},

Uberon provides a necessary bridge between anatomical structures in different taxa for cross-species inference. It uses novel methods for representing taxonomic variation, and has proved to be essential for translational phenotype analyses. Uberon is available at http://uberon.org.},

  abstract = {The Unified Medical Language System (http://umlsks.nlm.nih.gov) is a repository of biomedical vocabularies developed by the US National Library of Medicine. The UMLS integrates over 2 million names for some 900 000 concepts from more than 60 families of biomedical vocabularies, as well as 12 million relations among these concepts. Vocabularies integrated in the UMLS Metathesaurus include the NCBI taxonomy, Gene Ontology, the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), OMIM and the Digital Anatomist Symbolic Knowledge Base. UMLS concepts are not only inter-related, but may also be linked to external resources such as GenBank. In addition to data, the UMLS includes tools for customizing the Metathesaurus (MetamorphoSys), for generating lexical variants of concept names (lvg) and for extracting UMLS concepts from text (MetaMap). The UMLS knowledge sources are updated quarterly. All vocabularies are available at no fee for research purposes within an institution, but UMLS users are required to sign a license agreement. The UMLS knowledge sources are distributed on CD-ROM and by FTP.},
